This application is an example of my advanced (intermediate to semi-advanced in the example) coding knowledge. My example in "plot.luau" shows my knowledge of OOP (classes), networking, the server-client model, optimizations and memory-leak prevention, and much more including simple gui manipulation, the task library, and time. There is much included in the example, a total of over 800 lines of code just for handling plots, so please do not be intimidated by the code, it is a lot, but a lot of it is simply working with data, other stuff with just the plot overall. Thank you for taking the time to look at my application, have a good rest of your day!
